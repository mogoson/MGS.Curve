- Create **Renderer** to show curve in scene.
- Create **Collider** to check trigger in scene.
- Create **Cacher** to build curve to cache file and load curve from cache file.

## Usage

- Attach mono curve component to a game object.

```tex
MonoHermiteCurve MonoBezierCurve MonoHelixCurve MonoEllipseCurve MonoSinCurve
```

- Adjust the parameters of curve component or edit curve in scene editor.
